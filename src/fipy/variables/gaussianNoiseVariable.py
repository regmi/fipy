class GaussianNoiseVariable(NoiseVariable):
    r"""
    
    Represents a normal (Gaussian) distribution of random numbers with 
    mean :math:`\mu` and variance
    :math:`\langle \eta(\vec{r}) \eta(\vec{r}\,') \rangle = \sigma^2`,
    which has the probability distribution
    
    .. math::
        
       \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp -\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}

    For example, the variance of thermal noise that is uncorrelated in space and
    time is often expressed as
    
    .. math::
    
       \left\langle
           \eta(\vec{r}, t) \eta(\vec{r}\,', t')
       \right\rangle = 
       M k_B T \delta(\vec{r} - \vec{r}\,')\delta(t - t') 
       
    which can be obtained with::
        
        sigmaSqrd = Mobility * kBoltzmann * Temperature / (mesh.getCellVolumes() * timeStep)
        GaussianNoiseVariable(mesh = mesh, variance = sigmaSqrd)

    .. note:: 
        
       If the time step will change as the simulation progresses, either through
       use of an adaptive iterator or by making manual changes at different
       stages, remember to declare `timeStep` as a `Variable` and to change its
       value with its `setValue()` method.
    
    >>> import sys
    >>> from fipy.tools.numerix import *

    >>> mean = 0.
    >>> variance = 4.

    We generate noise on a non-uniform cartesian mesh with cell dimensions of
    :math:`x^2` and :math:`y^3`.
           
    >>> from fipy.meshes.grid2D import Grid2D
    >>> mesh = Grid2D(dx = arange(0.1, 5., 0.1)**2, dy = arange(0.1, 3., 0.1)**3)
    >>> from fipy.variables.cellVariable import CellVariable
    >>> volumes = CellVariable(mesh=mesh,value=mesh.getCellVolumes())
    >>> noise = GaussianNoiseVariable(mesh = mesh, mean = mean, 
    ...                               variance = variance / volumes)
           
    We histogram the root-volume-weighted noise distribution
    
    >>> from fipy.variables.histogramVariable import HistogramVariable
    >>> histogram = HistogramVariable(distribution = noise * sqrt(volumes), 
    ...                               dx = 0.1, nx = 600, offset = -30)
           
    and compare to a Gaussian distribution
    
    >>> gauss = CellVariable(mesh = histogram.getMesh())
    >>> x = histogram.getMesh().getCellCenters()[0]
    >>> gauss.setValue((1/(sqrt(variance * 2 * pi))) * exp(-(x - mean)**2 / (2 * variance)))
    
    >>> if __name__ == '__main__':
    ...     from fipy import viewers
    ...     viewer = Viewer(vars=noise, 
    ...                     datamin=-5, datamax=5)
    ...     histoplot = Viewer(vars=(histogram, gauss))
    
    >>> for i in range(10):
    ...     noise.scramble()
    ...     if __name__ == '__main__':
    ...         viewer.plot()
    ...         histoplot.plot()

    >>> print abs(noise.getFaceGrad().getDivergence().getCellVolumeAverage()) < 5e-15
    1

    Note that the noise exhibits larger amplitude in the small cells than in the large ones
