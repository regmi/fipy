    The `FixedValue` boundary condition adds a contribution, equivalent to a
    fixed value (Dirichlet condition), to the equation's RHS vector and
    coefficient matrix. The contributions are given by :math:`-\mathtt{value}
    \times G_{\text{face}}` for the RHS vector and :math:`G_{\text{face}}` for
    the coefficient matrix. The parameter :math:`G_{\text{face}}` represents the
    term's geometric coefficient, which depends on the type of term and the mesh
    geometry.

    Contributions are only added to entries corresponding to the
    specified faces.
