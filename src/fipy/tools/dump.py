    Pickle an object and write it to a file. Wrapper for
    `cPickle.dump()`.

    :Parameters:
      - `data`: The object to be pickled.
      - `filename`: The name of the file to place the pickled object. If `filename` is `None`
        then a temporary file will be used and the file object and file name will be returned as a tuple
      - `extension`: Used if filename is not given.

    Test to check pickling and unpickling.
