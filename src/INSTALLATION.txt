   For each package, please follow any instructions given in its `README` or 
   `INSTALLATION` files.


---------
Shortcuts
---------

Detailed prerequisites and links are given below and in 
`platform-specific instructions`_, but for the courageous and the
impatient, :term:`FiPy` can be up and running quickly with one of the
following methods.

Enthought Python Distribution
=============================

http://www.enthought.com/epd

This installer provides a very large number of useful scientific packages
for Python, including Python_, NumPy_, SciPy_, Matplotlib_, and IPython_.
Installers are available for Windows_, `Mac OS X`_ and `RedHat Linux`_.

.. attention::

   :term:`PySparse` and :term:`FiPy` are not presently included in EPD, so you will need
   to separately install them manually.

Python(x,y)
===========

http://www.pythonxy.com/

Another comprehensive Python package installer for scientific applications,
presently only available for Windows_. See :ref:`WINDOWS-INSTALLATION` for
more information.

----------
Privileges
----------

If you do not have administrative privileges on your computer, or if for
any reason you don't want to tamper with your existing Python_
installation, most packages (including :term:`FiPy`) will allow you to install to
an alternate location.  Instead of installing these packages with
``python setup.py install``,
you would use
:samp:`python setup.py install --home={dir}`,
where :samp:`{dir}` is the desired installation directory (usually "``~``" to
indicate your home directory).  You will then need to append
:file:`{dir}/lib/python` to your :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` environment variable.  See the
`Alternate Installation`_ section of the Python_ document "`Installing
Python Modules`_" [InstallingPythonModules]_ for more information, such
as circumstances in which you should use :option:`--prefix` instead of
:option:`--home`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Operating System
================

:term:`FiPy` is `tested regularly`_ on `Mac OS X`_ 10.4 "Tiger" and 10.5 "Leopard",
`Debian Linux`_ 4.0 "etch", `Ubuntu Linux`_ 10.10, and `Windows XP`_. We
welcome reports of compatibility with other systems, particularly if any
additional steps are necessary to install.

.. note::

   Simple instructions for `Mac OS X`_ users are in :ref:`MACOSX-INSTALLATION`.
   Simple instructions for Windows_ users are in :ref:`WINDOWS-INSTALLATION`.

The only elements of :term:`FiPy` that are likely to be platform-dependent
are the viewers, but at least one viewer should work on each platform.
All other aspects should function on any platform that has a recent
Python_ installation.

Many of the packages listed below have prebuilt installers for different
platforms (particularly for Windows).  These installers can save considerable
time and effort compared to configuring and building from source, although
they frequently comprise somewhat older versions of the respective code.
Whether building from source or using a prebuilt installer, please read and
follow explicitly any instructions given in the respective packages'
:file:`README` and :file:`INSTALLATION` files.

Required Packages
=================

.. warning::

   :term:`FiPy` will not run if the following items are not installed.

Python
------

http://www.python.org/

:term:`FiPy` is written in the :term:`Python` language and requires a Python_
installation to run.  :term:`Python` comes pre-installed on many operating
systems, which you can check by opening a terminal and typing
``python``, *e.g.*::

    $ python
    Python 2.3 (#1, Sep 13 2003, 00:49:11) 
    ...
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 

If necessary, you can download_ and install it for your platform 
<http://www.python.org/download>.

.. note::

   :term:`FiPy` requires at least version 2.3 of Python_. :term:`FiPy` has not yet
   been tested (and will almost certainly not work) with `Python 3.0`_.

.. _Python 3.0:   http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/
.. _download: http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.python.org/download/

NumPy
-----

http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/

Obtain and install the :term:`NumPy` package. :term:`FiPy` requires at least
version 1.0 of NumPy_.

.. attention::

   :term:`FiPy` no longer uses the older :term:`Numeric` or
   :term:`numarray` packages.

PySparse
--------

http://pysparse.sourceforge.net

:term:`FiPy` requires `Roman Geus`_' :term:`PySparse` package.

You can `download the PySparse archive`_ or check it out via anonymous SVN
download. From within the ``pysparse`` base directory, follow its included
instructions for building :term:`PySparse` for your platform. `PySparse Windows
installers`_ are available.

.. note::

   Windows users who choose to build from source should pay particular
   attention to the instructions in the INSTALL file in the base
   :term:`PySparse` directory.

.. warning::

   If pysparse is installed in a local directory a further path may
   have to be added to the :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` environment variable. For
   example, if::

       $ python setup.py install --home=/some/directory/some/where

   then both :file:`/some/directory/some/where` and
   :file:`/some/directory/some/where/lib/python` are required to be added
   to the :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`, e.g.::

       $ set PYTHONPATH=/some/directory/some/where:/some/directory/some/where/lib/python

.. warning::

   :term:`FiPy` requires version 1.0 or higher of :term:`PySparse`.

.. attention::

   In order to solve in parallel, both :term:`PySparse` and 
   :term:`Trilinos` are required.

.. _Roman Geus: http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://people.web.psi.ch/geus/
.. _download the PySparse archive: http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=101403
.. _PySparse Windows installers: http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=101403

Viewers
=======

:term:`FiPy` will work perfectly well without them, but at least one of the
following packages will be required to view the results of :term:`FiPy`
calculations. :term:`FiPy` will select the first viewer that is available
from the list below.  If more than one is installed, specify a viewer
by setting the :envvar:`FIPY_VIEWER` environment variable to either
"``gist``", "``gnuplot``" or "``matplotlib``".

Matplotlib
----------

http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net

:term:`Matplotlib` is a Python_ package that displays publication quality
results. It displays both 1D X-Y type plots and 2D contour plots for
structured data. It does not display unstructured 2D data or 3D data.
It works on all common platforms and produces publication quality hard
copies. Version 0.72.1 or higher is required. `Matplotlib installers
for specific platforms`_ are available 
<http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80706&package_id=82474>.

.. note::

   :term:`Matplotlib` is noticeably slower than :term:`Pygist` or Gnuplot.py_, but
   has superior image rendering and plotting functionality.

.. _Matplotlib installers for specific platforms: http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80706&package_id=82474

Gnuplot-py
----------

http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net

Gnuplot.py_ is a Python_ package that interfaces to :term:`gnuplot`, the
popular open-source plotting program. It displays both 1D X-Y type
plots and 2D contour plots for structured data but not for
unstructured data or 3D data. It works on all common platforms and
produces hard copies, however, it sometimes breaks on Windows. As a
general remark, the viewing quality using either :term:`Pygist` or
:term:`Matplotlib` is preferable.

.. _Gnuplot.py:       http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net

Pygist
------

http://hifweb.lbl.gov/public/software/gist/

The :term:`Pygist` package can be used to display simulation results. It
displays both 1D X-Y type plots and 2D contour plots for both
structured and unstructured data. It does not display 3D
data. Although stated as working on Windows, it does not seem to do a
good job of rendering on this platform. :term:`Pygist` works fine on other
common platforms. :term:`Pygist` no longer seems to be under development, but
is still recommended as a fast light weight alternative to
:term:`Matplotlib`.

.. attention::

   :term:`Pygist` requires the old Numeric module to be installed.

.. warning:: 

   The facility to produce hard copies in :term:`Pygist` does not work very well and
   may crash the :term:`FiPy` run. "``.eps``" and "``.cgm``" export seem to work.

.. note::

   If you experience difficulty building the native :term:`Pygist` viewer on
   `Mac OS X`_, you may wish to build the package with the :option:`--x11`
   option described in its documentation.

.. note::

   :term:`Pygist` can have problems finding color pallets, such as "``heat.gp``" and 
   "``work.gs``", when installed locally. You may need to set the 
   :envvar:`GISTPATH` environment variable to point to the directory containing 
   these files (you may find it as "``g/``" within the directory you 
   specified for :option:`--home`). 

.. _Pygist: http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://hifweb.lbl.gov/public/software/gist/

Mayavi
------

http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/

The `Mayavi 2`_ Data Visualizer is a free, easy to use scientific data
visualizer.  It displays 1D, 2D and 3D data. It is the only :term:`FiPy`
viewer available for 3D data. Other viewers are probably better for 1D
or 2D viewing. 

.. note::
   
   `Mayavi 2`_ is packaged for Ubuntu and Debian linux. Using the packaged versions makes installion much easier.

.. note::

   MayaVi 1 is no longer supported.

.. _Mayavi 2: http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi

--------------
Obtaining FiPy
--------------

:term:`FiPy` is freely available for download via Subversion_ or as a compressed
archive from <http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/download>. Please see :ref:`documentation:SVN` for 
instructions of obtaining :term:`FiPy` with Subversion_.

.. warning::

   Keep in mind that if you choose to download the `compressed
   archive`_ you will then need to preserve your changes when upgrades
   to :term:`FiPy` become available (upgrades via Subversion_ will handle
   this issue automatically).

.. _compressed archive:      http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/download/

Manual
======

You can `download the latest manual`_ from 
<http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/download/fipy.pdf>. Alternatively,
it may be possible to build a fresh copy by issuing the following
command in the base directory::

    $ python setup.py build_docs --latex --manual

.. note::

   This mechanism is intended primarily for the developers.  A
   command-line pdfTeX installation and several LaTeX packages are
   required; particularly :file:`memoir.cls`.  You will also need to add
   :file:`{~/path/to/fipy}/utils` to your :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` environment
   variable.

.. _download the latest manual:  http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/download/

------------
Testing FiPy
------------

From the base directory, you can verify that :term:`FiPy` works properly by
executing::

    $ python setup.py test

Depending on the packages you chose to install in `Optional Packages`_,
be sure to set the appropriate environment variables.  You can expect a few
errors if you did not install all of the recommended packages.

.. note::

   In order for Python_ to find the :term:`FiPy` modules, you will need to ensure
   that the base directory is added to your :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` environment
   variable, *e.g.*::

       $ setenv PYTHONPATH .:${PYTHONPATH}

   or::

       $ export PYTHONPATH=.:${PYTHONPATH}

If you chose to install the :mod:`scipy.weave` package, you should rerun the
tests with::

    $ python setup.py test --inline

A few tests will fail the first time as a result of the messages
output in the course of caching the compiled inline code, but a repeat
test should have no failures (although see "``repairing catalog by
removing key``" in the :ref:`FAQ`).

If :term:`FiPy` is configured for :ref:`PARALLEL`, you can run the tests 
on multiple processor cores with::

    $ mpirun -np {# of processors} python setup.py test

.. note::
   
   When running in parallel, there are two expected test failures in
   :mod:`examples.elphf.diffusion.mesh1D` and in
   :mod:`examples.diffusion.nthOrder.input4thOrder-line`. These failures are problems
   with those particular tests, not with the parallel mechanism itself.

---------------
Installing FiPy
---------------

It is not necessary to formally install :term:`FiPy`, but if you wish to do so
and you are confident that all of the requisite packages have been
installed properly and :term:`FiPy` passes its tests, you can install it by
typing::

    $ python setup.py install

at the command line.  Alternatively, you may choose not to formally install
:term:`FiPy` and to simply work within the base directory instead.  

If you choose to install, Python_ will find your :term:`FiPy` modules 
automatically. If you choose not to install, then you will need to ensure 
that the :term:`FiPy` distribution directory is appended to your ``PYTHONPATH`` 
environment variable (either "``.``" if you are working within the :term:`FiPy` 
directory, or "``~/path/to/fipy``" if you are working in your own directory).

.. _sec:UsingFiPy:

----------
Using FiPy
----------

To see examples of problems that :term:`FiPy` is capable of solving, you can run
any of the scripts in :mod:`examples`. 

.. note::

   We strongly recommend you proceed through :mod:`examples`, but at 
   the very least work through :mod:`examples.diffusion.mesh1D` to understand 
   the notation and basic concepts of :term:`FiPy`.

We exlusively use either the unix
command line or IPython_ to interact with :term:`FiPy`. The commands in
:mod:`examples` are written with the assumption that they will be executed from
the command line. For instance, from within the main :term:`FiPy` directory, you
can type::

    $ python examples/diffusion/mesh1D.py

A viewer should appear and you should be prompted through a series of
examples.

.. note::

   From within IPython_, you would type::

       >>> run examples/diffusion/mesh1D.py

In order to customize the examples, or to develop your own scripts, some
knowledge of Python syntax is required.  We recommend you familiarize
yourself with the excellent `Python tutorial`_ [PythonTutorial]_ 
or with `Dive Into Python`_ [DiveIntoPython]_.

As you gain experience, you will want to see
:ref:`FAQ-FlagsAndEnvironmentVariables` to learn about flags and 
environment variable that affect :term:`FiPy`.

-----------------
Optional Packages
-----------------

.. note::

   The following packages are not required to run :term:`FiPy`, but they can be helpful.

SciPy
=====

http://www.scipy.org/

Significantly improved performance has been achieved with the judicious use
of C language inlining, via the :mod:`scipy.weave`. `SciPy download
instructions`_ are available <http://www.scipy.org/Download>. We recommend
version 0.5.2 or greater.

.. note:: 

   A handful of test cases use functions from the SciPy_ library and will
   throw errors if it is missing.

.. _SciPy download instructions:   http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.scipy.org/Download

Gmsh
====

http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/

:term:`Gmsh` allows the creation of irregular meshes.

IPython
=======

http://ipython.scipy.org/

This interactive Python shell is nicer to use than the default, and 
integrates nicely with matplotlib_. Depending on platform, you may be able 
to download a binary or build from source.

Trilinos
========

http://trilinos.sandia.gov

:term:`Trilinos` provides solvers and preconditioners, and can be used instead of
:term:`PySparse`. :term:`Trilinos` preconditioning allows for iterative solutions to some
difficult problems that :term:`PySparse` cannot solve, and it enables
solving on parallel nodes.

.. attention::

   In order to solve in parallel, both :term:`PySparse` and 
   :term:`Trilinos` are required.

.. attention:: 
    
   :term:`Trilinos` is a large software suite with its own set of prerequisites, and
    can be difficult to set up. It is not necessary for most problems, and is
    **not** recommended in a basic install of :term:`FiPy`.

:term:`Trilinos` is built using the standard :command:`configure`,
:command:`make` and :command:`make install` method. The best approach that
we have found is as follows::

    $ cd trilinos-X.Y/
    $ mkdir BUILD_DIR    
    $ cd BUILD_DIR
    $ ../configure CXXFLAGS="-O3" CFLAGS="-O3" FFLAGS="-O5 -funroll-all-loops \
    > -malign-double" --enable-epetra --enable-aztecoo --enable-pytrilinos \
    > --enable-ml --enable-ifpack --enable-amesos --with-gnumake --enable-galeri

.. note::

   Recif reports that to build on a 64-bit system, the ``configure`` step
   needs to be::

       $ ../configure CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fpic" CFLAGS="-O3 -fpic" \
       > FFLAGS="-O5 -fpic -funroll-all-loops" \
       > --enable-epetra --enable-aztecoo  --enable-pytrilinos \
       > --enable-ml --enable-ifpack --enable-amesos --with-gnumake \
       > --enable-galeri

..

    $ make
    $ make install

Depending on your platform, other options may be helpful or necessary;
see ``../configure --help``, the :term:`Trilinos` user guide available from
http://trilinos.sandia.gov/documentation.html, or
http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/pytrilinos/faq.html for more
in-depth documentation.

.. note:: 
 
    Trilinos can be installed in a non-standard location by adding the
    :samp:`--prefix={$LOCAL_INSTALLATION_DIR}` flag to the configure step. If
    :term:`Trilinos` is installed in a nonstandard location, the path to the
    PyTrilinos site-packages directory should be added to the
    :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` environment variable; this should be of the form
    :file:`{$INSTALL_DIR}/lib/{$PYTHON_VERSION}/site-packages/`. Also, the path
    to the :term:`Trilinos` lib directory should be added to the
    :envvar:`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (on Linux) or :envvar:`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` (on Mac OS
    X) environment variable; this should be of the form
    :file:`{$INSTALL_DIR}/lib``.

.. note::

    If swig is in a non-standard place use the
    :samp:`--with-swig={$PATH_TO_SWIG_EXECUTABLE}` flag with the configure
    step.

.. note::
    
    See SURF2007_ for further details on installing and running Trilinos as well
    as installing on 64 bit machines.
    
:term:`Trilinos` solvers can be used to replace :term:`PySparse` solvers. If both
:term:`PySparse` and :term:`Trilinos` are present, useage can be controlled by setting
the :envvar:`FIPY_SOLVERS` environment variable to ``Trilinos`` or
``Pysparse``, or by passing a ``--Trilinos`` or ``--Pysparse`` flag to
the :term:`FiPy` script, overriding the environment. In the absence of these
indicators, :term:`FiPy` will default to using :term:`PySparse` if it is present.

.. note:: 

    :term:`Trilinos` solvers frequently give intermediate output that :term:`FiPy` cannot
    suppress. The most commonly encountered messages are:

     ``Gen_Prolongator warning : Max eigen <= 0.0``:
        which is not significant to :term:`FiPy`.

     ``Aztec status AZ_loss: loss of precision``:
        which indicates that there was some difficulty in solving the
        problem to the requested tolerance due to precision limitations,
        but usually does not prevent the solver from finding an adequate
        solution.

     ``Aztec status AZ_ill_cond: GMRES hessenberg ill-conditioned``:
        which indicates that GMRES is having trouble with the problem, and
        may indicate that trying a different solver or preconditioner may
        give more accurate results if GMRES fails.

     ``Aztec status AZ_breakdown: numerical breakdown``
        which usually indicates serious problems solving the equation which
        forced the solver to stop before reaching an adequate solution.
        Different solvers, different preconditioners, or a less restrictive
        tolerance may help.
